The purpose of this directory is to use file in the Macros folder to create amplitude vs. time plots from  Data_Files TB (test beam) files from Summer 2016 runs, originially located on lxplus in /eos/cms/store/group/dpg_ecal/comm_ecal/upgrade/testbeam/ECALTB_Jul2016/ntuples_V1/ntuples/. These files do not work properly on my local machine, (i.e. problems with h4->Draw()) and must be run on lxplus, the reason for this is currently unknown. Macros use some tricks learned from William Benoit's well documented code.

Macros/Event_Filter.C searches through spills and events of a given run data file for 'good' events, where good is defined as having some minimum peak amplitude. Macros/Plot_Average.C uses good spill and event numbers obtained from Event_Filter to normalize, center and plot these individual events along with an average wave. All outputs are sent to Outputs, and images are saved in Images.  

The ultimate goal is to make qualitative and quantitative comparisons of averaged, normalized waveforms from different Russian crystals. Knowing how results from these crystals differ can be useful when analyzing CMS data from these crystals. Different WF_ch's (information stored in analysis_* root file) correspond to different crystals. XTAL_C3 corresponds to a Russian crystal.
